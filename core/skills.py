"""Skill index: map a bound skill NAME to the skill bodies that claim it.

The cartridge loader refuses to resolve when a bound name does not resolve to
exactly one body. That check needs an index, and building one means touching the
filesystem — so it lives here, at the edge, and never inside `load`.

A skill name is `plugin:skill`. A plugin is a directory carrying
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; its skills are `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Two
plugins may legitimately be installed that both declare a skill of the same
name, which is exactly the ambiguity the loader exists to catch — so the index
maps a name to a LIST, and reports the collision rather than picking a winner.
